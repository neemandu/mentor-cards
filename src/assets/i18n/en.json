Out of a desire to enable growth and development for thousands of therapists and coaches in Israel and around the world, we built a friendly and super intuitive platform for our users, where they can work with cards in front of their clients. All this in online meetings exactly in the same way they used to in face-to-face meetings, with guidebooks full of explanations and examples. With one significant difference – without carrying, without effort, without feeling like dinosaurs. 😊",
